    "overview": "Heavenly is a massive resort straddling the California and Nevada states, renowned for its breathtaking panoramic views of Lake Tahoe from nearly every run. It boasts an incredibly diverse terrain spanning over 4,800 acres, from wide-open groomers to challenging tree runs and steep canyons, catering to all skill levels with its unique dual-state experience.",
    "localTips": [
      "Start on the Nevada side (Boulder or Stagecoach) on busy days to avoid the Gondola crowds and access the more open, faster lifts early.",
      "Utilize the Sky Express lift early to access prime intermediate terrain and get to the California side efficiently before it gets backed up.",
      "For fresh tracks on a powder day, head straight to Mott Canyon via the Mott Canyon gate (requires traversing) or Killebrew Canyon via the Comet Express.",
      "Catch a sunset from the Ridge Run or any run overlooking the lake on the California side; the views are unparalleled, especially as the last light hits.",
      "On sunny days, explore the tree runs around the Milky Way Bowl for softer snow and fewer crowds than the main groomed trails.",
      "Avoid eating at the Tamarack Lodge around peak lunch (12-1:30 PM); it gets incredibly crowded. Instead, pack a sandwich or try Stagecoach Lodge or East Peak Lodge for slightly less chaos.",
      "Keep an eye on the wind; the upper mountain lifts (Sky Express, Dipper Express, Comet Express) are often the first to go on high-wind days, shifting traffic to lower lifts.",
      "If you're an advanced rider, always check if Mott and Killebrew Canyons are open; they offer some of Heavenly's most challenging and rewarding terrain."

      "The Gondola mid-station food court during peak lunch hours; it's incredibly crowded and overpriced.",

      "Relying solely on the Gondola for uphill travel if you're comfortable driving to a base lodge; the lines can be daunting.",

    },
    "parkingStrategy": "Arrive by 8:00 AM on weekends and holidays for the best chance at free parking. The California Lodge lot offers convenient free parking with direct lift access, but fills quickly. Alternatively, head to the Boulder or Stagecoach Lodge lots on the Nevada side for free parking and quicker access to the mountain, though they are a bit further from South Lake Tahoe's main village. The Heavenly Village Gondola parking structure is convenient but paid ($20-30+ per day) and can fill by 9:00 AM on busy days.",
    "crowdPatterns": "Heavenly experiences significant crowds on weekends, especially during holiday periods and powder days. The Gondola line is typically the first to build by 8:30 AM. On-mountain, areas around Tamarack Lodge, the top of the Gondola, and the California Trail see the most traffic. Weekdays, especially Tuesday-Thursday, are significantly less crowded. Crowds tend to thin out on the far Nevada side (Boulder/Stagecoach areas) and in the advanced terrain of Mott and Killebrew Canyons. Lifts like Sky Express, Comet Express, and Dipper Express often have shorter lines after the initial morning rush."

    "overview": "Okemo is renowned for its impeccably groomed, wide-open cruisers, making it a paradise for intermediates and families. With a modern high-speed lift system and diverse terrain spread across several distinct faces, it offers a consistent, enjoyable experience for all ability levels, though true experts might seek more extreme challenges elsewhere.",
    "localTips": [
      "Start your day at Jackson Gore Peak; its dedicated parking lot, lift access (Jackson Gore Express), and base amenities often mean shorter lines early on compared to the Clock Tower base.",
      "Head to the South Face via the South Ridge Quad or Sunburst Six for less crowded, excellent intermediate cruising, especially after 11 AM when the Clock Tower crowds spread out.",
      "For consistent groomers, stick to the main trails off the Sunburst Six, particularly Upper and Lower World Cup, before they get skied off.",
      "On colder days or for a quick warm-up, utilize the enclosed bubbles of the Sunburst Six or Quantum Four lifts.",
      "Avoid the Green Ridge Triple on busy days; it's slow and often has long lines. Instead, use the Black Ridge Triple or traverse over from the Sunburst Six.",
      "The terrain off the Glades Peak Quad tends to be quieter and offers some fun, slightly less trafficked blue runs and accessible glades.",
      "Check the daily grooming report; Okemo's snowmakers and groomers are top-notch, and even after a lean spell, you can often find fantastic corduroy.",
      "Consider skiing the Clock Tower side first thing on a powder day; the steep pitches on Spillway and Outrage can offer great early turns before they get bumped out."

      "Paying full price for food at any on-mountain lodge: Generally overpriced for cafeteria-style fare. Consider bringing snacks and drinks, or utilize local restaurants in Ludlow for better value.",

    "parkingStrategy": "On weekends and holidays, aim to arrive by 8:00 AM (or even 7:30 AM on powder days) to secure good parking. The Jackson Gore Base (P1, P2 lots) is often the best bet, offering direct access to the Jackson Gore Express Quad and a less congested base lodge. The Clock Tower Base (Main Lot) fills up quickly; if targeting this area, arrive very early or be prepared for shuttle service from outer lots.",
    "crowdPatterns": "Expect significant crowds on weekends and holidays, especially from 9:30 AM to 1:00 PM, with lifts like the Sunburst Six, Quantum Four, and Jackson Gore Express seeing the longest lines. Mid-week offers an uncrowded experience with minimal lift lines. Lunchtime (12:00 PM - 1:30 PM) sees lodges packed and mid-mountain trails getting busy. Crowds typically thin out after 2:30 PM, making for great late-day laps, particularly on the South Face or Glades Peak."
