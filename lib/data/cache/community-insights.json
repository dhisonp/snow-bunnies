    "parkingStrategy": "For weekends and powder days, arrive at Canyon Lodge or Eagle Lodge by 7:30-8:00 AM to secure a free parking spot close to the lifts. If those are full, your best bet is to park at The Mill (Chair 23) or follow signs for satellite lots and take a shuttle. Main Lodge parking fills first and is often the most congested. Utilizing the free town shuttle system from your accommodation is always recommended to avoid parking hassle.",
    "crowdPatterns": "Mammoth sees its heaviest crowds on weekends, especially during peak season (mid-January to March) and holiday periods (Christmas/New Year, MLK, Presidents' Day). Mornings (9-10 AM) and afternoons (3-4 PM) see congestion at all base area lifts and the Panorama Gondola. Mid-day crowds tend to spread out on the mountain, but main arteries like Stump Alley and Broadway remain busy. Weekdays are significantly less crowded, with virtually no lift lines outside of storm days. The upper mountain lifts (e.g., Chair 23, 5) tend to manage crowds better than lower mountain express chairs on busy days."

Crowds thin out in the Back Bowls and Blue Sky Basin during lunchtime, as many return to the frontside for food. Weekends and major holidays (Christmas/New Year's, MLK, Presidents' Day) are consistently the busiest, with mid-week often offering noticeable relief, especially outside of peak holiday seasons."
